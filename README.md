This API connects to an **PostgreSQL**, so it's necessary to have a database environment up and running. Attached to the api project is a file called `database.tar`. This is the complete dump from the database I have created for this project. The user/ pass and database port can be found on the `queries.js` file.

All those dependencies as applied on `package.json` file, so no further action is needed.
